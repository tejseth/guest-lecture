# How I Got Into Sports Analytics

- Started coding in R when I was a freshman in college
- Wanted to recreate the graphs [@benbbaldwin](https://twitter.com/benbbaldwin) was posting on Twitter
- It started out tough but eventually everything clicked
- The lines of code that changed my life:

```{r install-nflfastR, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("nflfastR")
library(nflfastR)
library(tidyverse)
pbp <- load_pbp(2019)
pbp %>% select(posteam, defteam, down, ydstogo, yards_gained) %>% head()
```

# The Next Steps

- Receiving feedback through constructive criticism is huge
  - Easiest avenue for this is by posting on Twitter
  - Coding with other students interested in sports analytics can be very helpful
  - Some people are worried to put their stuff out there but the community is very welcoming
- Any coder can make a graph but can you glean analysis from it?
