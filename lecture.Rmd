## Why I was Interested in Sports Analytics

- When I was younger I was more interested in the back of baseball cards than the front
- Didn't necessarily like math class but was better at it than other classes
- In high school, I spent time messing around with sports data on Google Sheets
  - Would never do that again now that I know R... 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height= 300, out.width= 400, fig.align='center'}

## Learning to Code

- Started coding in R when I was a freshman in college
- Wanted to recreate the graphs [@benbbaldwin](https://twitter.com/benbbaldwin) was posting on Twitter
- It started out tough but eventually everything clicked
- The lines of code that changed my life:

```{r install-nflfastR, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("nflfastR")
library(nflfastR)
library(tidyverse)
pbp <- load_pbp(2019)
pbp %>% select(posteam, defteam, down, ydstogo, yards_gained) %>% head()
```

## Putting Projects Together

- Receiving feedback through constructive criticism is huge
  - Easiest avenue for this is by posting on Twitter
  - Coding with other students interested in sports analytics can be very helpful
  - Some people are worried to put their stuff out there but the community is very welcoming
  
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height = 200, fig.width= 800}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.nflfastr.com/reference/figures/card.png")
```

## Data Viz Over Time (Bad Example)

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height = 500, out.width= 500}
knitr::include_graphics("https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ORBY8Onl_irpgMQwDdnLLkr0ryXeLo2mY3cV19NaUJXVY_2D8NLeC63Kj_t5HwVk6v3BjH9-27biBmdJ4vzbvCN9uPGR1M0CceeQ2lY49uQnOcoGItu2pLd7vCXJUkZePmprp9OK")
```

## Data Viz Over Time (Good Example)

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.height = 500, out.width= 690}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.pff.com/2021/08/7-box-768x512.png")
```

## Getting a Sports Analytics Internship

- Posting articles on a website and graphs on Twitter gets attention
- Tweets are *fine* but making connections with people in the industry is one of the best things to do
  - Linkedin
  - Email
  - Twitter Direct Messages
- My Journey to Pro Football Focus
  1. Got in touch with a current intern there through Twitter DM's
  2. He gave me Eric Eager's email (the Director of Research & Development)
  3. Eric had seen my tweet and articles and knew I liked football and data
  4. Had an interview with him + a screening with HR
  
```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.height = 150, out.width= 500}
knitr::include_graphics("https://csva.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PFF-logo.png")
```

## Experience Working at PFF

- Working in the Research & Development team allowed me to grow in multiple facets
  - Gained experience working in teams on deliverable
  - Had my [writing](https://www.pff.com/analyst/tej-seth) be put on PFF's website
  - Got "clout" by being invited on [podcasts](https://t.co/TNVJVhc3sT)
  - Was given free range in creating new metrics
- Doing sports analytics doesn't feel like work because it's sports!

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.height = 350, out.width= 500}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.pff.com/2021/08/4-1-768x512.png")
```

## My Process for Generating New Ideas

- Think about something that isn't measured *quite* right
- Watching a lot of football helps conjure up ideas!
- Look into other sports and see how they are measuring performance
- Start with early data analysis (EDA) on the topic
- Make a simple model to see if the process is there
- Go to an advanced model if needed

```{r making-lm, message=FALSE}
library(nflfastR)
library(tidyverse)

pbp <- load_pbp(2021)
pbp_pass <- pbp %>%
  filter(pass == 1, !is.na(air_yards))

lm_air_yards <- lm(air_yards ~ as.factor(down) + ydstogo + yardline_100, 
                   data = pbp_pass)
```

## The Future of Sports Analytics

- It will be run by students like us!
- Even if you don't decide to go into sports analytics, being able to use tools
like R and/or Python to analyze, visualize and model data is an insanely useful skill
to have
- Analytics in the Pro's
  - the __MLB__ had their "Moneyball" takeover more than a decade ago
  - the __NBA__ just had their "Midrange" revolution
  - the __NFL__ is next as teams start to use tracking data to their advantage
  
```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.height = 300, out.width= 550}
knitr::include_graphics("https://waydev.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/moneyball-git-analytics.jpg")
